# Vodka - Lecture list bot

This bot helps student to cooperate with each other during lectures, when the lecturer checks the attendance. Absent students can ask their classmates to mark them as present. One instance of the bot shares all data with every server it is connected to, so students can ask for attendance in any server where the bot is present.
